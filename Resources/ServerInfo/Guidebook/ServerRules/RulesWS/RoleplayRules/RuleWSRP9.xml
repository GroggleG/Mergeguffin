  # Roleplay Rule 9 - Do not powergame.
  Powergaming refers to the act of trying to get a legup on other players by collecting certain items with no regard for roleplay. This rule is rather light and at the bottom of the list because it is not as strictly enforced as others. Please, dont powergame.
