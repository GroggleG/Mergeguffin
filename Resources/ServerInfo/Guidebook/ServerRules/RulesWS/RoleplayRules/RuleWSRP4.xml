  # Roleplay Rule 4 - Don't act like an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are one
  Acting like an antagonist when you are not one is often referred to as "self-antagging" or being a "self-antag", both of these things are against the rules. You are not an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are an antagonist. Do not make yourself a major problem, annoyance, or disruption while not an antagonist. Regular crewmembers can assist antagonists with good IC reasoning, but assisting an antagonist doesn't mean you get a pass on acting like one. If in doubt, ask an admin if a particular action is okay. Depending on the level of assistance, sufficient IC reasoning ranges from treating everyone who goes into medbay regardless of their history, to bartering contraband, to performing actions under threat of death. As a non-antagonist, try to have a positive impact on the round.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that you are not an antagonist.

  Acceptable:
  - Stealing or breaking a glass from the bar.
  - Replacing someone's shoes with clown shoes.
  - Giving everyone all access during war ops. (This is not necessarily a good idea)
  - Helping an antagonist due to them holding someone important hostage.
  - Starting a revolution because command is being unreasonable.
  - Starting a cult that has no negative impact on the round.
