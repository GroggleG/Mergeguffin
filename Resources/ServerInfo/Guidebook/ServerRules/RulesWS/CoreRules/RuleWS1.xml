    # Rule 1 - Don't be a dick.
    Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone else’s good time, you won’t have a place here.
Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome. Intentionally ruining people's fun is only fun for the person doing it.
