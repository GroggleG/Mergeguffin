    # Rule 6 - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means and vice versa.
    I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the
game via things like Discord, known as metacomms. Characters are otherwise allowed to 
know everything about ingame mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent
friendships or relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair

    This also goes the other way around. Do not use current round information outside of the round as this can also lead to metagaming.
