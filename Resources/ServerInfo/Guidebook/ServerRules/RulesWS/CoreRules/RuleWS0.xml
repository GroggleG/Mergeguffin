    # Rule 0 - Enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of admins, and therefore interpretation is up to them.
    These rules are not perfect. The rules attempt to clearly communicate what the admin team intends to be allowed and prohibited, but there are likely loopholes or other flaws that can be "lawyered". Don't attempt to manipulate the interpretation of the rules to suit your personal goals or to degrade the experience of other players. If you are unsure of something, follow the more restrictive option until you are able to ask an admin and get clarification.
    
    Admins are fully accountable for any consequences should they decide to
invoke this rule. Admins are also allowed to intervene in rounds when
it is in the best interest of the Playerbase/Community/Server.
