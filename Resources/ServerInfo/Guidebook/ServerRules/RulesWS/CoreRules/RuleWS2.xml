    # Rule 2 - Don't Discriminate Against Others.
    Once more, be excellent to eachother. Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, disability, orientation or the like is not tolerated. It is not our goal to create or enforce a list of banned words and instead our goal to eject the expression of bigotry from the community. Enforcement will be less PC based and more common sense based with that goal in mind. 


    ## Examples
    Allowed:
    - Calling someone a "retard" in the context of insulting their intelligence or calling them inept.
    - Being rude to a lizard for being a lizard.
    - Calling plasmamen a "fungal colony" or a moth a "furball"


    Prohibited:
    - Calling someone a "retard" specifically to discriminate against those with mental deficiencies.
    - Blatant racism, masked as IC or not.
    - Being rude to someone because they are Jewish IRL
