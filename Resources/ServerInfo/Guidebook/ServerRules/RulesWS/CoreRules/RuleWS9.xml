    # Rule 9 - Do not abuse, ignore, or threaten to use the 'Ahelp' system.
    Admin help, or "ahelp", is the system used by admins to communicate with specific players in the game. Only use admin help for things requiring admin attention. If you ignore messages admins send to you via ahelp, or disconnect during an ahelp, you may be banned. If you urgently need to leave during an ahelp, you may do so but will likely need to continue the ahelp on the forums. Do not admin check, be hostile/aggressive, request events, or spam. IC methods of contacting admins, like prayers, faxes, red phones, and banana phones, should be used when there is not an issue.

    With this in mind, it is important to understand that using the ahelp system to threaten members of the community is also abusing this system. The system is not to dish out threats but to help administration enforce the rules. If someone threatens to ahelp you or you threaten to ahelp someone expect a kickback.
