    # Welcome!
    Hello and welcome to Weasel Station! We have a focus on fun and have rules to match, you may be saying to yourself "I dont want to read these, why do I have to follow rules to have fun?"

    ## TL;DR
    There’s a lot here, but the gist of the rules is roleplay takes priority. Don’t murder just for fun if you’re not antag. Don’t metagame. Don’t play to win. Don’t be a jerk OOCly. If you don’t understand what those words mean or you need more detail, read on!
